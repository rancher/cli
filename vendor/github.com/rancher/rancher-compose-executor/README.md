# Compose compatibility

`rancher-compose` strives to be completely compatible with Docker Compose.  Since `rancher-compose` is largely focused
on running production workloads some behaviors between Docker Compose and Rancher Compose are different.

## Deleting Services/Container

`rancher-compose` will not delete things by default.  This means that if you do two `up` commands in a row, the second `up` will
do nothing.  This is because the first up will create everything and leave it running.  Even if you do not pass `-d` to `up`,
`rancher-compose` will not delete your services.  To delete a service you must use `rm`.

## Builds

Docker builds are supported in two ways.  First is to set `build:` to a git or HTTP URL that is compatible with the remote parameter in https://docs.docker.com/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.18/#build-image-from-a-dockerfile.  The second approach is to set `build:` to a local directory and the build context will be uploaded to S3 and then built on demand on each node.

For S3 based builds to work you must [setup AWS credentials](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/#configuring-credentials).
