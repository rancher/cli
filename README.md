Rancher CLI
===========

The Rancher Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified tool to interact with your Rancher server. 

## Installing

You can check the [releases page](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases) for direct downloads of the binary or [build your own](#building). 

## Setting up Rancher CLI with Rancher Server 

The CLI needs to know your server address and the credentials required to authenticate with it. 
Rancher CLI will pull this information from a `cli.json` that is created the first time you run 
`rancher config`. By default this file is located at `~/.rancher/cli.json`. 

```
$ rancher config

URL []: <RANCHER_SERVER_URL>
Access Key []: <RANCHER_API_ACCESS_KEY>
Secret Key []: <RANCHER_API_SECRET_KEY>
Environments:
[1] env_name
```

> Note: The `<RANCHER_SERVER_URL>` includes whatever port was exposed when installing Rancher server.

If you want to use Rancher CLI on a server that uses a self signed cert you will need to download the cert from `<RANCHER_SERVER_URL>/v3/settings` and pass that into `rancher login` using `--cacert` 

## Building from source

The binaries will be located in `/bin`.

### Linux binary

Run `make`.

### Mac binary

Run `CROSS=1 make build`

## Docker image

Run `docker run --rm -it rancher/cli [ARGS]`  You can pass in credentials by bind mounting in a config file.

To build `rancher/cli` just run `make`.  To use a custom Docker repository do `REPO=custom make` and it will producte `custom/cli` image.
