Rancher CLI
===========

The Rancher Command Line Interface (CLI)is a unified tool to manage your Rancher server. With this tool, you can control your services, containers and hosts within a Rancher environment and automate them through scripts. 

## Version Compatibility
Rancher CLI v0.2.0+ is only compatible with Rancher Server v1.2.0+. 

## Running

You can check the [releases page](https://github.com/rancher/cli/releases) for direct downloads of the binary or [build your own](#building). 

## Setting up Rancher CLI with Rancher Server 

To enable the CLI to connect to Rancher server, you can configure the environment variables needed. The environment variables that are required are `RANCHER_URL`, `RANCHER_ACCESS_KEY` and `RANCHER_SECRET_KEY`. 

The access key and secret key should be an [account API key](http://docs.rancher.com/rancher/latest/en/api/api-keys/#account-api-keys). In your Rancher setup, you can create an account API key under the **API** tab and expand the **Advanced Options**. 

You can run `rancher config` to set these environment variables for the CLI. 

```
$ rancher --url http://<RANCHER_SERVER_URL> config
URL [http://<RANCHER_SERVER_URL>]: 
Access Key [http://<RANCHER_SERVER_URL>]: <ACCESS_KEY>
Secret Key [http://<RANCHER_SERVER_URL>]: <SECRET_KEY>
INFO[0102] Saving config to /Users/<username>/.rancher/cli.json 
```

> Note: The `<RANCHER_SERVER_URL>` includes whatever port was exposed when installing Rancher server. If you had followed the installation instructions, your URL would be `http://<server_ip>:8080/`.

## Building

The binaries will be located in `/bin`.

### Linux binary

Run `make`.

### Mac binary

Run `CROSS=1 make build`

### Docker image

Run `docker run --rm -it rancher/cli [ARGS]`  You can pass in credentials by bind mounting in a config file or setting env vars.  You can also use the wrapper script in `./contrib/rancher` that will make the process a bit easier.

To build `rancher/cli` just run `make`.  To use a custom Docker repository do `REPO=custom make` and it will producte `custom/cli` image.

### Auto Complete
PROG=rancher source <(rancher complete bash) # setup autocomplete in bash.
